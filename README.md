# Product Feedback App

###LIVE DEMO CAN BE FOUND [HERE](https://infallible-nightingale-0aeab5.netlify.app/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This interactive React app allows users to add, update, and delete feedback for a product. In this project I practiced my knowledge of the following React concepts:

- Components
- JSX
- Props(proptypes, defaultprops)
- State(Component & App Level)
- Handling Events
- Forms

# Usage

## Install Dependencies

### `npm start`

## Run

### `npm run dev`

This will run the React app on port :3000.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
